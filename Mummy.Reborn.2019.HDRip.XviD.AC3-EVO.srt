00:00:57,564 --> 00:00:59,363
Tell me more
about your gap year.

3
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:01,099
It sounds so interesting.

4
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:02,600
No, don't be silly.

5
00:01:02,602 --> 00:01:05,202
Come on, I can't believe
how many lives you've saved.

6
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:08,439
No, I just did what I
think was right, you know?

7
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,306
How's your mum?

8
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:10,441
Oh, mummy.

9
00:01:10,443 --> 00:01:11,842
Yeah, she's fine.

10
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:13,111
She got herself a dog.

11
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:14,646
Keeps her entertained.

12
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:16,815
She didn't really strike
me as much of dog person.

13
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:18,917
Oh god no, she just wanted
something big and hairy

14
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:21,318
to have a go at after dad died.

15
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:26,459
I'm gonna get some more bubbly.

16
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,534
Help me.

17
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:33,858
Where are you?

18
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,122
Okay, come on, Max.

19
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,389
Just one leg in, okay?

20
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,092
One, again.

21
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:21,093
That's it.

22
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,493
Okay, and the other one.

23
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,831
That's it, okay?

24
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:27,267
You all right?

25
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:28,801
I don't like the water.

26
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:30,102
I wanna get out.

27
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,403
Max, please, come on.

28
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,875
- It's just a bit of a bath.
- I don't like it, Tina.

29
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:39,211
I said I don't need a bath
at this very moment of time.

30
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,812
Max, please, you
need to have a bath.

31
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,047
Come on, you stink.

32
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,482
You can't go around
walking like that.

33
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,884
Huh?

34
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,552
Come on, it'll be quick, okay?

35
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,190
Hey, Karen, what's up?

36
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:55,827
No, I wasn't ever booked
in for work today.

37
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,829
What, are you serious?

38
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,198
Oh god, I am so sorry Karen.

39
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,166
I had no idea.

40
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,701
I don't suppose you can
get it covered at all?

41
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:06,904
No, I understand, yeah.

42
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,639
Sure, yeah, yeah.

43
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,374
Sure, yeah, yeah,
I'll make it work.

44
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,675
Don't worry about that, okay?

45
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:13,510
Give me an hour, okay?

46
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:14,578
See you soon.

47
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,414
Bye.

48
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,519
I don't want a bath
right this minute!

49
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,222
Fine.

50
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,856
Okay, you don't want a bath?

51
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:26,723
You're not gonna get a bath.

52
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,160
Come on, get out.

53
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,598
Tina is mad at me.

54
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,132
No, Max, okay.

55
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,401
Tina's just really, really
stressed out right now, okay?

56
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,869
Okay, come on, you
wanted out, so,

57
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:41,472
get out then, okay?

58
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:11,369
I can see you, Brenda.

59
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:17,141
Oh.

60
00:06:19,377 --> 00:06:20,211
Hi, Tina.

61
00:06:25,816 --> 00:06:28,817
Oh my god, thank you for
coming on short notice.

62
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:30,385
Sorry, I just, I messed up.

63
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:32,519
I had no idea I
was at work today.

64
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:34,621
So, um, yeah, just let
him watch movies all day

65
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:36,858
and, yeah, I'll
be back by dinner.

66
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,692
Okay, it's all right.

67
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:40,161
Tina doesn't like me.

68
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,396
Max, stop, okay?

69
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:43,467
You know that's not true.

70
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,734
Maxie, Tina does like you.

71
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:49,806
She shouts at me,
and she hates me.

72
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,111
Tina, can we just have a word?

73
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:58,545
Yeah, it's, wait,
can we chat later?

74
00:06:58,547 --> 00:07:01,449
You know I can't
keep doing this, right?

75
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:05,219
You know, coming here to take
care of him all the time.

76
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:06,787
I mean, when I signed off,
you acted like you were

77
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:08,222
gonna be your brother's
full time carer

78
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:10,524
once I was relieved.

79
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:12,393
And you've had to
fight tooth and nail

80
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:13,961
to get full time
custody of your brother

81
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:15,062
after your mother's passing.

82
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:17,398
What are you saying?

83
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,966
I just would be careful.

84
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:19,801
Of what?

85
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:24,904
All I'm saying is that
you are very young, okay?

86
00:07:24,906 --> 00:07:26,572
And you're taking on
a huge responsibility

87
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:28,875
looking after him, okay?

88
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:30,343
And I understand it, all right?

89
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:34,548
You've got, you've got work,
bills, even more bills.

90
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:38,751
You know, you just,
you need to decide

91
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:40,686
what route to take.

92
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:44,092
I'm sorry, what do
you mean what route?

93
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:46,959
I think you should
let him be looked after

94
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:48,363
by professionals.

95
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:51,531
Just people who know
what they're doing,

96
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,366
just until you can
get yourself sorted.

97
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:55,700
You know, your feet
off the ground.

98
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:58,538
Okay, like this situation,
I can tell it's not

99
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,940
good for you, and it's
definitely not good for him.

100
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:02,941
Okay, yeah.

101
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:04,643
We'll talk about this later.

102
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:05,478
Tina.

103
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,945
Brenda.

104
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:09,347
I appreciate you coming
today to help, I really do.

105
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:11,185
But I won't ask again.

106
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:14,654
See you later.

107
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,332
And how
much is this one?

108
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:37,900
Two pounds, 75.

109
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:39,435
Are you serious?

110
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:42,004
Well if you don't want
to pay that, then fuck off.

111
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:42,840
God!

112
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:46,643
But I didn't do anything.

113
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:47,876
Tina.

114
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,944
What time do you call this?

115
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:50,012
You said an hour, tops.

116
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:51,213
I know, I know, I know Karen.

117
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,148
Look, I'm sorry, I
did the best I could.

118
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,882
I shouldn't even
be here right now.

119
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:56,518
I've got an appointment
with my sex therapist

120
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,852
which I'm incredibly late for.

121
00:09:57,854 --> 00:10:00,055
I am never going to come.

122
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,723
I completely understand,
look, I struggle with

123
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:03,493
Luke sometimes, so.

124
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:04,760
I canceled the
appointment, Tina.

125
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:05,961
No, Karen, go.

126
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:07,229
Honestly, look, it's worth it.

127
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,130
Okay, look, I'm here right now.

128
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:09,364
I can man the store.

129
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:10,899
Look, I need to
talk to you anyway.

130
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,732
Go on.

131
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:12,968
The shop.

132
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,937
We're not pulling
in enough sales.

133
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:16,271
Well I wonder why that is.

134
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:19,174
Why are you still here?

135
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:21,108
Karen, what are you saying?

136
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,111
I've had to resort to
selling things online.

137
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:25,581
Book Face, List of Craig.

138
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,048
I think you mean Craigslist.

139
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,551
And that's not the store
that I set out to own.

140
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:31,919
No, Karen, look I can help.

141
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:33,787
We keep marketing it,
pushing the products,

142
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:34,888
write advertisements.

143
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,591
I can make YouTube videos.

144
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,058
It's Tube You.

145
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,293
Look, I don't think
there's any way of saving

146
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:40,461
the shop, Tina.

147
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:41,295
Not now.

148
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:42,597
Karen, no.

149
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,665
Oh, it's not as if we
didn't see this coming.

150
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,534
We've spent way too
much money promoting it,

151
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:50,238
and no one wants this stuff,
not in this day and age.

152
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,907
Look, it absolutely
kills me to say it,

153
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:54,342
but I've had to bite the bullet,

154
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:55,775
and I'm calling it quits.

155
00:10:55,777 --> 00:10:58,613
Karen, please
don't, okay, look.

156
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:00,814
Karen, is there
nothing that we can do?

157
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:03,783
I can't lose my job, it
is all I've got left.

158
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:06,152
It's not a decision I've
made lightly but it is

159
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:08,321
a decision I have made.

160
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:09,724
I can't undo it at this point.

161
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:11,725
I've already had
interest selling it.

162
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:13,093
Karen, please.

163
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:15,128
I can't lose this.

164
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,331
It's all I've got, too,
but I'm not even bringing

165
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,798
enough to pay your wages.

166
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,702
I'm literally paying out
to keep the store open,

167
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:25,471
and come next week,
we'll be shut.

168
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:28,173
I really do have to go
now and I'm very sorry

169
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:31,176
you're the last to know,
but what I need of you today

170
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:34,179
is to go into the back,
and inventory everything,

171
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:35,448
make a list of everything.

172
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,449
I've got to put it
all up for auction

173
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,684
and make some money back.

174
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:38,618
Okay.

175
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,122
Look, I really do have to go.

176
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:43,190
Oh.

177
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,126
That's a really tight hug...

178
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:49,461
I know, sweetie, I
know, I know, I know.

179
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:52,533
Poor little thing,
poor little thing.

180
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:47,342
Max, please talk to me.

181
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:49,577
All right then.

182
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,512
Get that down ya.

183
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:52,013
Thank you for doing this.

184
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:53,348
It's all right.

185
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,417
What's a boyfriend for, eh?

186
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,419
So remember this after
I've had a long day.

187
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:01,690
Someone's hungry.

188
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:04,894
Max, stop.

189
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:06,995
Don't talk to me.

190
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:10,098
Just finish, eat your
dinner properly, please.

191
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,866
You're not my mom.

192
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,934
Oh, I know that, okay?

193
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,204
But I'm now in the place
of mom, so you gotta listen

194
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:18,573
to me when I say for
you to eat your dinner.

195
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:20,608
I don't have to
do what you say.

196
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,113
Yes you goddamn do
when I pay the bills.

197
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,583
Mom gave you this
house when she died.

198
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:32,753
So you should not
pretend you paid for it,

199
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,655
because you did not.

200
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:35,823
No.

201
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:37,256
You're right.

202
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:38,594
You're so right.

203
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:43,630
But you know what
mom did do, hm?

204
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,065
She left us in a
shit load of debt

205
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:51,004
and no Max, actually, she didn't
pay for this house at all.

206
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:52,739
She still had a
mortgage out on it

207
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:54,743
and today I lost my job.

208
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:57,845
So you'd better get used
to the idea that living

209
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,180
here won't last.

210
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,016
I miss mom.

211
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:06,686
Just finish your
goddamn dinner, Max.

212
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:07,522
Please.

213
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:09,390
Max.

214
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,225
Just let him go away now.

215
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:14,562
No, Luke, he needs to eat.

216
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:18,698
Look, you shouldn't
talk to him like that.

217
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,633
What do you mean
you lost your job?

218
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:22,467
It's exactly how it sounds.

219
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:25,670
So today I lost my job,
turns out nobody wants to buy

220
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:27,272
antique crap anymore,
oh, and the business

221
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,774
basically went piss out, yeah.

222
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:31,676
What about, like, hipsters?

223
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:33,545
No, they don't actually
buy anything though, okay?

224
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:36,315
They just mope around the store.

225
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:38,283
Just, I, I, I can't eat.

226
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:39,117
Where are you going?

227
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:39,952
I need a bath, okay?

228
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:41,789
I've lost my appetite.

229
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,243
Max?

230
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:43,716
Oh, Maxie.

231
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:48,219
I'm so sorry, okay?

232
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:51,688
I'm sorry for the way I've been

233
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,792
and how I've treated you.

234
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:57,159
I don't want it this way, okay?

235
00:16:57,161 --> 00:17:01,332
It's just I have so much
on me right now, you know?

236
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:07,803
Hey, look.

237
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:09,137
Hey.

238
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:10,474
I miss mom, too.

239
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:15,914
God, I really miss her, Max.

240
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:21,251
I just don't know if I
can do this on my own,

241
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:25,287
but I can't let you go, no, Max.

242
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:27,589
I love you, you're
my brother, okay?

243
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:30,258
I can't not have you in my life.

244
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,160
I promised mom I would
always look after you,

245
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:35,131
no matter what happened.

246
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:41,137
It's just, I, I just
get angry, okay?

247
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:47,410
I get angry because
I'm mad at myself

248
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:51,045
because I can't give you
what I promised I would

249
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:54,784
when mom died, and I
have totally failed you.

250
00:17:57,654 --> 00:17:59,555
And I am so sorry, Max.

251
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:03,959
And I wish I could bring
Mom back but I can't.

252
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:07,563
I can't, and I really
want to, but I can't.

253
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:14,537
I promise you, I'm gonna
make everything better, okay?

254
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,439
It's all gonna change.

255
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:20,910
Hey.

256
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:25,311
And I thought I was
your second mommy, hm?

257
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,482
Thought you were.

258
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:32,087
Okay, well.

259
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:35,955
Get some rest, it'll all be
different in the morning.

260
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:37,025
It always is.

261
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,330
Luke.

262
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:22,734
What are you doing
with my work papers?

263
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:23,835
You know she's
got this, right?

264
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:25,104
Mhm.

265
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:26,504
She's got
this in her stock.

266
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:28,107
Yeah.

267
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,040
Yeah?

268
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,975
That's worth like 800 grand.

269
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:32,910
Jesus, I knew it'd
be worth a bit, but,

270
00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:35,415
well, Karen's gonna be sorted.

271
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:38,951
- Do you think that...
- What?

272
00:19:38,953 --> 00:19:40,052
Nothing, oh, it's stupid.

273
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,487
What, Luke, come on.

274
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:45,057
Babe, that's worth
like three houses.

275
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:45,892
Yeah.

276
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,660
I'm just saying, it would
solve a lot of problems.

277
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:51,929
Like, what are you saying?

278
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,933
I think you know what.

279
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:56,901
Wait, no, no, no, no.

280
00:19:56,903 --> 00:20:00,637
If I steal that, I could
go to jail for years.

281
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,073
No.

282
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,306
No, I'm not saying
that you should steal it.

283
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:03,975
I'm not saying that
I should steal it.

284
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:05,176
I'm just saying.

285
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:07,310
No, get to the goddamn point.

286
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:10,213
I'm just saying
that I know a guy,

287
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:11,715
who knows a guy,

288
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:13,784
who knows another guy.

289
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:18,690
Well.

290
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,499
Hey.

291
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:30,934
He says he'll do it.

292
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:32,536
For 50%.

293
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:33,369
Right.

294
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,172
Wait, who is this guy?

295
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:37,540
He's just a guy into
this sort of thing.

296
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,675
You know, stealing
and selling it on.

297
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:41,577
Are you talking about
your drummer Duncan?

298
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,781
Eh, yeah, drummer Duncan.

299
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:45,815
Look, Tina, he says
he's got a client

300
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:47,049
for this sort of thing.

301
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:48,651
If we can just get ahold of her.

302
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:50,119
So how do we get it?

303
00:20:50,121 --> 00:20:50,953
You've just got to
leave the back door open,

304
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:52,320
that's what he said.

305
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:53,356
Okay, look.

306
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:56,992
What if they take it, take
off, and we don't get a penny?

307
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,260
What if I get caught, Luke?

308
00:20:58,262 --> 00:21:00,328
You've got nothing
to be caught for.

309
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,830
They're doing all the work.

310
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:03,665
All you've got to do is
leave that back door open.

311
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:04,899
This'll change your life, Tina.

312
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:08,371
Make it so much easier
if you just say yes.

313
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:25,187
All right, all right.

314
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:27,156
You ready?

315
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:28,389
Of course I am.

316
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,061
I was born ready, let's go baby!

317
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:47,374
What if they take the amulet
and sell it for themselves?

318
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:48,343
I've know Duncan for years.

319
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:50,510
He wouldn't do that to me.

320
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:52,079
Look, relax, Tina.

321
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:53,580
It's gonna be fine.

322
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:55,916
Remember Paris, eh?

323
00:22:01,523 --> 00:22:03,525
Luke, it's just, look.

324
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,426
What I'm worried about is...

325
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:09,263
It's gonna be fine, nothing
bad is gonna happen, Tina.

326
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:10,297
Do you trust me?

327
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:12,266
Right, this is it.

328
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:13,800
All you've got to do
is go and open the door

329
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:15,534
and then that's it, you're out.

330
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,436
We'll wait for the call, I'll
meet you at the safe house

331
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:19,273
and then that's it.

332
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:21,241
Your life, our lives.

333
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:22,242
They change forever.

334
00:22:22,244 --> 00:22:25,245
Yeah.

335
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,950
Lukey, long time
no see, brother.

336
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:32,985
I saw you at band
practice last week, Dunc.

337
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:33,986
Oh yeah.

338
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:35,087
Luke, this is Ali.

339
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,188
Hi.

340
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,656
She's the look out.

341
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,058
And that silly cow blinding
everyone with the lights

342
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,092
is Jas.

343
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:42,328
And I, I'm the main man.

344
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,063
Should we get goin', eh?

345
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:45,597
Anyone could turn
up at any minute.

346
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,067
Oh, she a keeper isn't she?

347
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:50,269
Luke, come on, man, let's
get the doors unlocked.

348
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:51,906
Aye, you got Tina.

349
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:04,918
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

350
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,295
Holy shit.

351
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,631
Nice.

352
00:23:57,003 --> 00:24:00,437
Oh my god.

353
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,805
Oi, we're taking this.

354
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:04,241
Tell Jas to bring the
truck 'round, yeah,

355
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,077
and drop the tailgate.

356
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,327
Hey.

357
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:24,594
It's done.

358
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:25,830
They've got it.

359
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:31,236
It's all gonna get better now.

360
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:53,488
It was just like that when
I got here this morning.

361
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,392
So you have no idea
what time this took place?

362
00:24:57,394 --> 00:24:58,527
No, I don't have a clue.

363
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:00,561
That's what the security
footage was for.

364
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:03,198
Karen, what's happened?

365
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,266
Oh, I don't know.

366
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:06,100
I don't, I don't know.

367
00:25:06,102 --> 00:25:08,903
I must've left the
back door open when I

368
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:10,371
shut up shop last night.

369
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:14,443
Someone, someone broke
in and they stole the box

370
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:16,777
from the back room.

371
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:19,081
The security
footage, everything.

372
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,348
Everything.

373
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,250
Well, whoever it was,
they certainly knew the

374
00:25:22,252 --> 00:25:23,984
layout of the store.

375
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,586
Why do you say that?

376
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:27,188
Well, 'cause they
knew where the security

377
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,956
cameras were.

378
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,691
They took them.

379
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:33,294
They covered their tracks.

380
00:25:33,296 --> 00:25:36,629
I understand you're
about to go bankrupt.

381
00:25:36,631 --> 00:25:38,365
You think I stole this.

382
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:40,367
You think I would
do such a thing?

383
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:43,337
Hang on, I'm not some
kind of fraud or sneak.

384
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,872
I don't walk around
wearing a fucking trilby.

385
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:48,775
Hm, I've heard
crazier stories.

386
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:50,210
Crazier still when
you consider those

387
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:52,412
who wear trilbys.

388
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:57,117
Stories like these, like
trying to recoup costs.

389
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,618
Do not make light of this.

390
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,554
This is a very
dangerous situation.

391
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:02,856
Look, it's not about the money.

392
00:26:02,858 --> 00:26:05,758
I don't give a rat's
ass about the money.

393
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,931
Whoever took this is in
serious danger, detective.

394
00:26:16,938 --> 00:26:19,771
Whoever took this is in
serious danger, detective.

395
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:21,474
Serious danger, detective.

396
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:24,410
Serious danger, detective.

397
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:49,334
Look mate, would you relax?

398
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:51,203
She's gonna be here in
a bit, have a drink.

399
00:26:51,205 --> 00:26:53,338
Come on, man, I'm looking
after her brother, aren't I?

400
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,540
Oh is that who he is?

401
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:55,806
Yes, Tina's little brother.

402
00:26:55,808 --> 00:26:57,176
He's asleep upstairs,
so let's keep it down

403
00:26:57,178 --> 00:26:58,544
or turn that off or something.

404
00:26:58,546 --> 00:27:00,112
I don't want him getting
involved, you know.

405
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:01,712
What's all this,
gamey soldiers?

406
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:03,948
Luke, you're having
a drink, mate.

407
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,882
Now.

408
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,652
Cheers to being bloody men!

409
00:27:06,654 --> 00:27:08,286
Let's go, men, ah!

410
00:27:08,288 --> 00:27:09,720
Let's get pissed.

411
00:27:09,722 --> 00:27:11,291
Let's go men, ah!

412
00:27:52,998 --> 00:27:54,233
Oh, mum's here.

413
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:57,067
How was it, how was work?

414
00:27:57,069 --> 00:27:58,767
Yeah, all right.

415
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:00,869
Well, she doesn't suspect me.

416
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:02,572
Should they really be
drinking that much?

417
00:28:02,574 --> 00:28:05,074
It won't bother
them, it's fine.

418
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:06,543
Seriously Tina, this is it.

419
00:28:06,545 --> 00:28:10,779
They've done it, this is the
start of the rest of your life.

420
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,081
Where is it?

421
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:13,616
You wanna see it?

422
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:14,450
Yeah.

423
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:15,686
Come with me.

424
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:20,725
Yes, mate!

425
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:28,764
Luke, what the hell?

426
00:28:28,766 --> 00:28:29,699
What?

427
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:31,567
They stole the entire tomb?

428
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:33,669
They were meant to just
take the goddamn amulet.

429
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,870
Well I don't know, maybe
they got carried away.

430
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:38,340
They can probably sell
what's in the box, eh?

431
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,743
No, it's just, Karen,

432
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:43,077
she said something dangerous
could happen with it.

433
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,312
Like what?

434
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:46,347
I don't know, okay,
it's just today,

435
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,249
she looked really freaked
out and it wasn't over

436
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:49,752
the cash she lost, Luke.

437
00:28:49,754 --> 00:28:51,753
It was over this thing.

438
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:53,354
It's just a box, Tina.

439
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,591
It's not like that film with
your man Brendan Fraser.

440
00:28:56,593 --> 00:28:58,726
What's the worst
that could happen?

441
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:00,395
Has anyone opened it yet?

442
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:01,230
Nope.

443
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,869
We were waiting for you.

444
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:13,241
So you're saying some
weird shit could come out

445
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:14,509
and poison us, yeah?

446
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:15,743
No, she doesn't
know that for sure.

447
00:29:15,745 --> 00:29:18,011
What did your
boss say, exactly?

448
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:19,280
Well.

449
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:21,549
She said that it was
extremely dangerous

450
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,618
and that she was really
worried about whoever had it.

451
00:29:24,788 --> 00:29:26,186
Oh come on, just
open it, it'll be fine.

452
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:27,122
Go on, Jas.

453
00:29:43,672 --> 00:29:44,604
Oh, it stinks.

454
00:29:44,606 --> 00:29:45,806
Should we be breathin' that in?

455
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:47,606
Aye, I've smelt
worse coming from you.

456
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:48,874
Dickhead.

457
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:50,109
Kind of wanna peel the
wrap off and see what

458
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:51,243
it looks like underneath.

459
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:54,180
Oh you're sick, you know that?

460
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:55,516
We just could.

461
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:02,389
Yeah, it looks better
on the mummy, Jas.

462
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:04,225
Oh fuck off, Duncan.

463
00:30:06,394 --> 00:30:08,260
I wonder if it's
a boy or a girl.

464
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:10,896
What's a boy or a girl?

465
00:30:10,898 --> 00:30:12,365
Max.

466
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:13,232
No.

467
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:14,736
Come on, let's go.

468
00:30:21,174 --> 00:30:22,340
Okay.

469
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:23,676
Max.

470
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:26,578
Max, come on listen
to me please, come on.

471
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,016
Okay, so, I am letting
you use my laptop,

472
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:33,220
so you can't break it, okay?

473
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:35,653
All right, so just so you know,

474
00:30:35,655 --> 00:30:37,655
I have disabled purchase buying,

475
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:40,124
especially after you
bought that chocolate.

476
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:42,893
I never purchased
that chocolate.

477
00:30:42,895 --> 00:30:45,062
Okay, well, Maxie,
if you need anything,

478
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:46,464
I'll be outside.

479
00:30:46,466 --> 00:30:47,267
Okay?

480
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:50,904
Don't do anything else.

481
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,743
Look, Tina, Tina.

482
00:30:58,745 --> 00:31:00,177
You okay?

483
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:01,515
How could you?

484
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:06,316
The one thing I asked you,
no, wait, I specifically

485
00:31:06,318 --> 00:31:09,388
asked you not to
bring him, didn't I?

486
00:31:10,823 --> 00:31:12,689
My god, I asked you, look,
I said not to bring him.

487
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:14,057
I didn't want him
involved in any of it.

488
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:15,459
Look.

489
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:16,959
I'm sorry, okay, I
thought Brenda would take

490
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,195
care of him for the weekend
but she said she couldn't.

491
00:31:19,197 --> 00:31:20,029
What do you mean she couldn't?

492
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:21,532
She always helps out.

493
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:24,400
She said you hadn't paid
her for the last few times.

494
00:31:24,402 --> 00:31:26,837
She's not coming
'round any more.

495
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:27,672
Oh.

496
00:31:30,975 --> 00:31:35,044
She said she thought I
should put Max in a home.

497
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:38,047
I need you to answer me
honestly on this, okay?

498
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:38,882
Sure.

499
00:31:38,884 --> 00:31:40,451
Now don't lie to me.

500
00:31:40,453 --> 00:31:42,753
Just tell me straight.

501
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:46,224
Do you think I'm unable
to look after Max?

502
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:48,658
Wow.

503
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,461
Really?

504
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:52,261
You think it, too, you
think I'm unsuitable

505
00:31:52,263 --> 00:31:53,429
to look after him?

506
00:31:53,431 --> 00:31:54,697
Don't come to
conclusions, all right?

507
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:55,665
I just think it
was a lot for you

508
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,032
to take on after your mum died.

509
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:59,002
Don't follow me, okay?

510
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:01,136
Christ.

511
00:32:01,138 --> 00:32:01,972
Tina!

512
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:04,439
- Tina!
- Leave me alone.

513
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:05,373
No, Tina!

514
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,843
Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke.

515
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:08,009
Let me chat to her, yeah?

516
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,544
You just go in there, calm down,

517
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:12,714
get yourself a beer, and leave
it to old Dunkers here, yeah?

518
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:14,485
I'm great with women.

519
00:32:22,627 --> 00:32:24,192
You know he means
best for you, right?

520
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,028
Sure.

521
00:32:26,965 --> 00:32:29,564
Look, I don't know what you
two are fighting about, but,

522
00:32:29,566 --> 00:32:30,899
whatever it is, I'm
just telling you now,

523
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:32,100
he aint about to do
this sort of shit

524
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:33,702
for just anyone, do you hear?

525
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:36,371
This is some proper risky
shit he's up to here.

526
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,239
Yeah, I know, I'm just
finding it all really difficult

527
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:39,273
in the moment.

528
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:40,109
Hm.

529
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,730
So you do this full time?

530
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,165
I wouldn't say it's
nine to five, no, but,

531
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,667
I make a living doing
shit like this, yeah.

532
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:08,835
I'm guessing this
is the biggest job

533
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:09,736
you've done so far.

534
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,140
Could be, yeah.

535
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:14,408
Usually it's smaller stuff.

536
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,175
Got a pretty meaty
grab on this one.

537
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:17,143
Oh, who's the buyer?

538
00:33:17,145 --> 00:33:18,379
Don't know.

539
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:19,713
I usually just hand the
stuff over to the guys

540
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:21,214
who sells stuff to the buyer.

541
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:23,817
The buyer don't wanna get
his hand dirty, you see.

542
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:25,953
Right, and you trust him?

543
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:27,587
I do, yeah.

544
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,289
Is it me, or
can you hear that?

545
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:32,358
Yeah, what?

546
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,460
It sounds like a party's
going on or something.

547
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:35,662
Leave 'em to it.

548
00:33:35,664 --> 00:33:39,331
We leave them alone,
they'll leave us alone.

549
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,833
I mean, I'm sure we
can take our business

550
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:43,404
somewhere more quiet, personal.

551
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,072
How do you feel about that?

552
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:15,903
No.

553
00:34:17,738 --> 00:34:19,470
No, no, no, no.

554
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:34,051
Okay, asshole, let's
get this straight.

555
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:37,388
I'm only here for one thing
and it sure as hell aint that,

556
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,024
so get your shitty
little hands off me

557
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:43,995
and don't you dare treat
me like one of your hoes.

558
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:44,929
My hands aren't
shit, actually.

559
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:45,998
I'm an excellent drummer.

560
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,932
Fuck off asshole.

561
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:47,732
- Duncan...
- Hey.

562
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:49,702
Put your dog on a leash.

563
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,374
Is it really weird
that I wanna screw you

564
00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:58,274
in front of the mummy?

565
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:01,714
Oh well you naughty
minx, come on, then.

566
00:35:37,683 --> 00:35:39,181
Max, it's me, come on.

567
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:40,784
Open up, please.

568
00:35:40,786 --> 00:35:42,418
I wanna be alone.

569
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,787
Go away.

570
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:48,857
Come on, Maxie, you can't
be angry at me forever.

571
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:49,958
Hm?

572
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,028
Yes, I can.

573
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:54,496
Okay, well.

574
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:55,597
When you're ready to
speak to me again,

575
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,668
I'll be downstairs, okay?

576
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:02,372
Ah, whoa, on my bed?

577
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:08,145
Get in there!

578
00:36:12,582 --> 00:36:13,848
This is so bloody
weird, you know that?

579
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:17,085
What's fun about being normal?

580
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,619
So, already drinking then, hm?

581
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:52,755
Not anymore.

582
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,291
Guns.

583
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:00,626
Nice.

584
00:37:00,628 --> 00:37:02,129
Of course they would bring guns.

585
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:03,829
Of course you would bring
my brother to a place

586
00:37:03,831 --> 00:37:05,297
full of guns.

587
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:07,134
Look, Tina, can we just
stop this, all right?

588
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:08,367
I'm not trying to
make things worse.

589
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:09,635
I'm not trying to
upset you, you know.

590
00:37:09,637 --> 00:37:12,139
I know, I know, okay, look.

591
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:13,707
I'm sorry, okay?

592
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:16,610
It's just, look, I
took it personal.

593
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:19,746
It's just, the truth is, well,

594
00:37:19,748 --> 00:37:22,314
the truth is, I know I'm
doing a really crappy job

595
00:37:22,316 --> 00:37:25,051
right now and, I just get angry.

596
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:26,619
I just want change, Luke.

597
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:28,020
I know you do.

598
00:37:28,022 --> 00:37:30,022
And that's why we're
doing this, remember.

599
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:32,527
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

600
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:38,063
All right.

601
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:39,531
How's Max?

602
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,033
Yeah, he's fine, he was
playing with his dinosaur, so.

603
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:43,269
- Okay, cool.
- Yeah.

604
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:52,979
I wanna look at the
mummy while you do me.

605
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:55,079
What the hell?

606
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,047
What, you can't look?

607
00:37:56,049 --> 00:37:56,950
No, look.

608
00:38:01,856 --> 00:38:02,787
Yeah.

609
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:04,589
What the hell?

610
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:06,225
Max.

611
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:07,725
Max?

612
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,195
What is it?

613
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:10,962
Something's seem to have
gone flippin' wonkers.

614
00:38:10,964 --> 00:38:12,397
What's going on?

615
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:13,631
The mummy is missing
and so is the amulet.

616
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:14,465
How can it just be missin'?

617
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:15,700
Who saw it last?

618
00:38:15,702 --> 00:38:16,968
Well we were in
here messing about.

619
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,468
One minute it was here,
and the next it's gone.

620
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,071
Someone come into this
room and flippin' took it.

621
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:21,738
Who would take the mummy?

622
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,274
Well unless it's got
up and gone for a walk

623
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:25,676
on its own, how else
do you explain it?

624
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,680
Oh, I know who's got it.

625
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,016
Move!

626
00:38:33,018 --> 00:38:34,084
What the hell, Duncan?

627
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:35,519
Max, Max!

628
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,020
Open this door!

629
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:38,421
Shut up, shut up!

630
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:39,790
Shut up, shut up!

631
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,091
Calm down, Duncan.

632
00:38:41,093 --> 00:38:43,293
Calm down, okay,
I'll talk to him.

633
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:45,361
Just calm down.

634
00:38:45,363 --> 00:38:47,631
Max, baby, it's me, okay?

635
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:49,466
Open the door for me, please.

636
00:38:49,468 --> 00:38:51,201
I'm not gonna let him
hurt you, I promise.

637
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,537
Just open the door, Max, please.

638
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,072
For me?

639
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:57,074
Max, come on mate, open
the door for her, please.

640
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:58,541
I didn't meant to scare ya.

641
00:38:58,543 --> 00:38:59,375
I just want a little chat.

642
00:38:59,377 --> 00:39:00,811
Max, come here.

643
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:02,346
Oh look, there he is, yeah?

644
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:03,913
I'm really sorry about
what I shouted, mate.

645
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:05,182
I didn't mean to scare ya.

646
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:07,850
Basically, yeah, um,
I just wanna know

647
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:09,385
where's the mummy, yeah?

648
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:10,620
And where's the amulet?

649
00:39:10,622 --> 00:39:11,454
What have you done with it?

650
00:39:11,456 --> 00:39:12,722
No, Duncan!

651

Where's the mummy
and the amulet?

I don't know
where the amulet is.

He's trying me, Luke,
he's really trying.

657
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:29,338
I saw the mummy.

see the mummy Max?

be on it now, aye?

bit less of the theatrics?

00:50:22,774 --> 00:50:23,773
Splits?

819
00:50:27,511 --> 00:50:32,516
For some reason, you look
extremely sexy right now.

820
00:50:36,152 --> 00:50:40,290
Am I really stoned, or
there's money on the floor?

821
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:45,028
You can make it rain any day
of the week, Kylie.

822
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:47,765
Legit though,
keeper's finders!

823
00:50:55,406 --> 00:50:57,041
Come on, hurry up.

824
00:50:59,175 --> 00:51:00,776
Like seriously?

825
00:51:00,778 --> 00:51:03,477
Normally it's like
hard as a rock.

826
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:06,982
I think it's like, I banged
one out this morning.

827
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:08,649
What are you chatting?

828
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:10,219
Just give it to me.

829
00:51:13,156 --> 00:51:15,892
I'm just trying
to wake him up.

830
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,325
Oh.

831
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:19,660
The more the merrier.

832
00:51:19,662 --> 00:51:20,494
Who's your mate?

833
00:51:20,496 --> 00:51:21,862
Maybe he can go first?

834
00:51:21,864 --> 00:51:22,964
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

835
00:51:22,966 --> 00:51:24,297
Don't take it off.

836
00:51:24,299 --> 00:51:25,565
I've always wanted
to do it with someone

837
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,801
that I couldn't see the face of.

838
00:51:27,803 --> 00:51:30,337
What are you
actually talking about?

839
00:51:31,306 --> 00:51:33,341
Who's your mummy?

840
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,141
What the fuck?

841
00:52:03,304 --> 00:52:04,873
Fucking dickhead!

842
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:17,181
Guys!

843
00:52:17,183 --> 00:52:18,019
Run!

844
00:52:22,024 --> 00:52:23,959
That's not cool, man.

845
00:52:27,194 --> 00:52:29,131
Cool special effects.

846
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,769
This isn't corn syrup.

847
00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:46,613
Who ordered a mummy?

848
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,947
Dude.

849
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:52,752
He even smells
like a real corpse.

850
00:54:03,521 --> 00:54:05,188
Where'd they all go?

851
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,522
- Back to Egypt.
- Luke.

852
00:54:06,524 --> 00:54:07,623
Well I don't know, do I?

853
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,258
Guys.

854
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:17,133
I think there's something
wrong with Jasmine.

855
00:54:17,135 --> 00:54:19,068
Stop messing about, dude.

856
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,435
I don't like being
cooped up in here you know.

857
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:21,871
Pull yourself together, Luke.

858
00:54:21,873 --> 00:54:23,072
We need a find a way to get out

859
00:54:23,074 --> 00:54:24,739
before we're torn apart
by fucking Jasmine.

860
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:27,909
There are worse ways to die.

861
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:28,743
Amen.

862
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:29,577
- Luke.
- Tina.

863
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:30,411
- Max.
- Luke.

864
00:54:30,413 --> 00:54:31,247
- Tina.
- Max.

865
00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:32,380
- Luke!
- Max.

866
00:54:32,382 --> 00:54:33,515
- Tina.
- Hey.

867
00:54:33,517 --> 00:54:35,018
- No, Max.
- Tina.

868
00:55:15,624 --> 00:55:16,892
They're here.

869
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,677
Okay, Tina.

870
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:38,178
- Maxie.
- No!

871
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,012
No.

872
00:55:39,014 --> 00:55:40,013
But, Tina!

873
00:55:40,015 --> 00:55:41,447
Oi!

874
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:43,616
I am not losing another
family member, Luke.

875
00:55:43,618 --> 00:55:46,019
You're not a hero, Max.

876
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:47,453
Hey, Tina, you've
got your car keys?

877
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,588
Check.

878
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,089
I've got the heat.

879
00:55:50,091 --> 00:55:51,557
Now the scream came from
outside, so we're gonna go

880
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:54,093
'round the back to maintain
the element of surprise.

881
00:55:54,095 --> 00:55:54,929
Let's go.

882
00:56:36,535 --> 00:56:37,802
Fuck.

883
00:56:37,804 --> 00:56:40,604
I am so sick of these
motherfuckin' mummies

884
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,941
on this motherfuckin' farm.

885
00:56:42,943 --> 00:56:43,776
Fuck.

886
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:01,292
I can't understand
what he's saying.

887
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:03,626
Can't you just
read the subtitles?

888
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:04,861
What?

889
00:57:04,863 --> 00:57:07,463
They are saying
the amulet can give

890
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,000
and take away his power.

891
00:57:10,002 --> 00:57:12,870
And there is a missing piece.

892
00:57:12,872 --> 00:57:14,874
They are looking for it.

893
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,453
Are there any other
left alive there?

894
00:57:30,455 --> 00:57:32,357
Jas, what's going on?

895
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:34,958
I've killed people.

896
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,426
We did.

897
00:57:36,428 --> 00:57:37,659
What?

898
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:38,593
The others.

899
00:57:38,595 --> 00:57:40,495
Where are the others?

900
00:57:40,497 --> 00:57:42,432
There's a girl, and Duncan.

901
00:57:42,434 --> 00:57:45,002
Her boyfriend, Duncan's friend.

902
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:06,358
We need to leave, now.

903
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:08,391
Aye.

904
00:58:08,393 --> 00:58:10,592
We can stop 'em.

905
00:58:10,594 --> 00:58:12,196
We take the amulet.

906
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:14,264
Now!

907
00:58:15,531 --> 00:58:16,934
Max, no!

908
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:06,838
Max!

909
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,972
Why did you run in like that?

910
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:09,441
That was so stupid.

911
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:10,374
Let him be.

912
01:00:10,376 --> 01:00:11,976
I wanted to help, Tina.

913
01:00:11,978 --> 01:00:13,177
I wanted to save her.

914
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,745
So what, if I
don't give you gun,

915
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:18,585
that means run in there
like a raving lunatic?

916
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:21,422
What did you call me.

917
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:24,223
No, no, no, no, Max.

918
01:00:24,225 --> 01:00:27,158
I didn't mean that,
no, no, no, no, Max,

919
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,993
I didn't mean that, okay?

920
01:00:28,995 --> 01:00:31,097
What were you gonna do?

921
01:00:32,832 --> 01:00:37,836
Tina doesn't trust Max, but
Tina doesn't trust Tina.

922
01:00:38,471 --> 01:00:39,570
Tina's a mess.

923
01:00:39,572 --> 01:00:41,339
Tina can't fix it.

924
01:00:41,341 --> 01:00:43,807
I'm sorry okay,
I didn't mean it.

925
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:44,641
Max!

926
01:00:46,645 --> 01:00:49,346
- Max...
- I can look after myself.

927
01:00:49,348 --> 01:00:50,647
Max, come on, I'm sorry.

928
01:00:50,649 --> 01:00:52,382
Don't touch me, I'll scream.

929
01:00:52,384 --> 01:00:53,185
Max.

930
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,196
Oh my god.

931
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:42,198
He's right, it is my problem.

932
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,832
No Tina, this is my mess.

933
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:46,335
It was my stupid
idea that led us down

934
01:01:46,337 --> 01:01:48,369
this mummified rabbit hole.

935
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:49,837
No.

936
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,940
No, I agreed to it.

937
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:52,907
It was my workplace.

938
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,642
I should have just said no.

939
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:55,944
Come on Tina.

940
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:58,380
All I've done is put
Max in extreme danger.

941
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,715
How are you to know this
is how it was gonna pan out?

942
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,284
Remember why you did it?

943
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:03,885
Because I was fucking selfish.

944
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:04,919
No.

945
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,455
That's not why.

946
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:07,855
Remember why you said yes.

947
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,191
No, I did it for him, for Max.

948
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,027
Exactly.

949
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:12,896
And now...

950
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:18,066
And now I have to
finish it for him.

951
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,900
You can't call the police,
what are you gonna tell them?

952
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,803
I'm not calling the cops.

953
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,516
Hi, mom.

954
01:03:09,284 --> 01:03:13,419
I know I haven't texted
you in a few hours.

955
01:03:13,421 --> 01:03:15,323
I've been kind of busy.

956
01:03:16,524 --> 01:03:19,860
Things haven't been
going good recently.

957
01:03:22,195 --> 01:03:24,229
It's been kind of tough.

958
01:03:24,231 --> 01:03:28,033
Things haven't been
great with Tina.

959
01:03:28,035 --> 01:03:29,704
I know she loves me.

960
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:33,608
She just doesn't
seem very happy.

961
01:03:35,842 --> 01:03:38,680
Anyway, I hope you
are doing okay.

962
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:43,283
I know you can hear me.

963
01:03:44,284 --> 01:03:45,687
I miss you a lot.

964
01:03:48,088 --> 01:03:50,989
I wish you were still here.

965
01:03:50,991 --> 01:03:52,159
Love you, mom.

966
01:03:53,026 --> 01:03:53,860
Max.

967
01:04:36,602 --> 01:04:37,835
Tina?

968
01:04:37,837 --> 01:04:38,836
- Have you seen them again?
- Nothin'.

969
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:40,237
I don't want to go in last,

970
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:41,438
and I wish the
mummies weren't here,

971
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,140
but she'll be coming
any minute now.

972
01:04:44,142 --> 01:04:46,042
It's like trying to find
the needle in the mummy.

973
01:04:46,044 --> 01:04:47,276
Luke, please don't.

974
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,314
Wait.

975
01:04:55,587 --> 01:04:56,452
Karen.

976
01:04:56,454 --> 01:04:57,320
Tina.

977
01:04:57,322 --> 01:04:59,188
- Karen.
- Luke.

978
01:05:00,124 --> 01:05:01,824
Karen.

979
01:05:01,826 --> 01:05:03,160
I was worried.

980
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:07,462
I thought I was going to
encounter one of those things.

981
01:05:07,464 --> 01:05:08,699
Have you seen any?

982
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:11,367
Yes, Karen, that's
why we called you.

983
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:13,870
Now, I'm not going to
get into what it's doing

984
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:15,271
all the way out here missy.

985
01:05:15,273 --> 01:05:16,372
Now is not the time.

986
01:05:16,374 --> 01:05:18,276
- Karen...
- Quiet, Luke.

987
01:05:20,177 --> 01:05:23,078
I'm largely leaning towards
not saying a peep if,

988
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,515
and it's a big if, you
help me get the mummy

989
01:05:26,517 --> 01:05:28,216
back in the box.

990
01:05:28,218 --> 01:05:31,086
Tell us what we need to do.

991
01:05:31,088 --> 01:05:32,921
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

992
01:05:32,923 --> 01:05:34,389
The amulet is the source
of the mummy's power,

993
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:36,858
but it can also take
his powers away,

994
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:38,193
and the only way you can
get him back to sleep

995
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:40,862
is to cram him back
into his coffin?

996
01:05:40,864 --> 01:05:43,330
And also sometimes when he's
around, the weather changes.

997
01:05:43,332 --> 01:05:44,566
Exactly.

998
01:05:44,568 --> 01:05:45,366
Very well summarized
for everyone listening

999
01:05:45,368 --> 01:05:46,835
in this circle, Luke.

1000
01:05:46,837 --> 01:05:49,970
Although it's slightly more
of a box than a coffin.

1001
01:05:49,972 --> 01:05:51,972
What we need to do: we
have to cause a distraction

1002
01:05:51,974 --> 01:05:53,207
and get them outside.

1003
01:05:53,209 --> 01:05:54,708
You run back into
the house, Tina,

1004
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:56,378
steal back the other
half of the amulet.

1005
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,579
Okay, yeah, I can do this.

1006
01:05:57,581 --> 01:05:58,880
- I can see this through.
- That's right Tina.

1007
01:05:58,882 --> 01:06:00,282
Yes, you can.

1008
01:06:00,284 --> 01:06:01,817
We're bloody lucky
somebody broke that amulet,

1009
01:06:01,819 --> 01:06:03,017
otherwise the mummy's
powers would be

1010
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:04,853
damn near unstoppable.

1011
01:06:04,855 --> 01:06:06,922
Whoever broke it has
given us a shot at

1012
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:09,425
saving the entire world today.

1013
01:06:10,593 --> 01:06:13,127
I've got something
to tell you guys.

1014
01:06:13,129 --> 01:06:14,528
Max.

1015
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:15,629
Max.

1016
01:06:15,631 --> 01:06:16,799
I am so sorry.

1017
01:06:18,801 --> 01:06:21,067
I didn't mean it,
I promise, okay?

1018
01:06:21,069 --> 01:06:23,303
I'm gonna make it better again.

1019
01:06:23,305 --> 01:06:25,373
I promise, I am so sorry.

1020
01:06:26,609 --> 01:06:27,675
Are you okay?

1021
01:06:27,677 --> 01:06:29,175
Huh?

1022
01:06:29,177 --> 01:06:32,045
I know where the missing
piece of the amulet is.

1023
01:06:32,047 --> 01:06:32,848
How?

1024
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:36,416
Great.

1025
01:06:36,418 --> 01:06:38,016
Max and Tina, back inside.

1026
01:06:38,018 --> 01:06:39,486
Try and find that
piece of the amulet.

1027
01:06:40,322 --> 01:06:42,254
Karen, you're with me.

1028
01:06:42,256 --> 01:06:44,692
Let's go bag ourselves a milf.

1029
01:06:44,694 --> 01:06:45,527
Hoo rah!

1030
01:06:55,035 --> 01:06:56,769
Oi, dickhead.

1031
01:07:14,355 --> 01:07:16,524
Damn, I wish Max was here.

1032
01:08:55,586 --> 01:08:57,755
Come on, get the amulet.

1033
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:01,824
Max, come on.

1034
01:09:01,826 --> 01:09:02,758
I'm looking, Tina.

1035
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,526
We don't have a lot of time.

1036
01:09:14,505 --> 01:09:15,339
Max?

1037
01:09:16,307 --> 01:09:17,408
Max, come on.

1038
01:09:18,341 --> 01:09:19,443
Come on, Max.

1039
01:09:21,112 --> 01:09:22,811
Found it.

1040
01:09:30,654 --> 01:09:31,719
Eh, I'm not
finished with you yet

1041
01:09:31,721 --> 01:09:33,456
you bandagy dickhead.

1042
01:10:09,758 --> 01:10:12,761
Is that all you've
got, Cleopatra?

1043
01:13:06,662 --> 01:13:10,168
It could have been
different between us.

1044
01:13:50,672 --> 01:13:52,240
Finish her.

1045
01:14:12,527 --> 01:14:13,361
Max.

1046
01:14:15,363 --> 01:14:16,896
The gun.

1047
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:22,337
You said not to use the gun.

1048
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:24,339
Use the gun.

1049
01:14:31,178 --> 01:14:33,681
I've only got one mummy now.

1050
01:14:34,848 --> 01:14:36,617
And her name is Tina.

1051
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:42,054
Max.

1052
01:14:42,056 --> 01:14:42,890
Max, Max.

1053
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:45,293
Max.

1054
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:47,893
Max.

1055
01:14:47,895 --> 01:14:51,298
Max, come on, you're
gonna be okay, all right?

1056
01:14:52,633 --> 01:14:54,900
You're gonna be fine.

1057
01:14:54,902 --> 01:14:56,335
I'll stop this bleeding.

1058
01:14:56,337 --> 01:14:59,271
It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna fine.

1059
01:14:59,273 --> 01:15:01,539
You're fine, I
promise, you're fine.

1060
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:03,375
You're gonna be okay.

1061
01:15:03,377 --> 01:15:05,143
It's all over now.

1062
01:15:05,145 --> 01:15:06,544
I'm a hero.

1063
01:15:06,546 --> 01:15:07,812
Yes, you are.

1064
01:15:07,814 --> 01:15:10,216
You are, Max, you are a hero.

1065
01:15:11,184 --> 01:15:12,917
Yes you are.

1066
01:15:12,919 --> 01:15:14,153
You're my hero.

1067
01:15:17,223 --> 01:15:18,655
Max.

1068
01:15:18,657 --> 01:15:19,489
I love you.

1069
01:15:23,997 --> 01:15:24,830
Max, Max.

1070
01:15:26,265 --> 01:15:27,398
Max!

1071
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,232
Max!

1072
01:15:28,234 --> 01:15:29,833
Max, wait, no!

1073
01:15:29,835 --> 01:15:31,134
Max, please.

1074
01:15:31,136 --> 01:15:33,971
Wake up, come on, this
isn't funny Max, please.

1075
01:15:33,973 --> 01:15:35,172
Max, wake up.

1076
01:15:35,174 --> 01:15:37,074
Please wake up.

1077
01:15:37,076 --> 01:15:39,145
Max, Max, Max, it's fine.

1078
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,381
Come on, wake up, come on.

1079
01:15:43,383 --> 01:15:46,217
Max come on, please
don't do this to me.

1080
01:15:46,219 --> 01:15:47,650
I can't lose you, Max.

1081
01:15:47,652 --> 01:15:50,153
I can't lose you,
please don't leave me.

1082
01:18:14,829 --> 01:18:16,063
I understand.

1083
01:18:23,737 --> 01:18:24,905
Martin's dead.

1084
01:18:28,341 --> 01:18:29,743
And the amulet?

1085
01:18:36,016 --> 01:18:38,183
Initiate order seven.

1086
